<h2>
<br> First decide who will go first!! But since your opponent for this game now will be 
<br> an AI, than it's gonna be you who will go first!!
</h2>
<br><h1> Place your ship!! </h1>
<h2>
<br>
<br> Now it's time for you to choose your ships and then put them in the map that we've already been prepared for you!!
<br> There are 5 ships with different length that you can place! And you can place each ship in the map horizontally or vertically
<br> You can just click on the ship and then move your cursor to the map to give you the "shadowing" of where you will put the ship
<br> after you place the ship, you will be given a coordinate for each ship so that you can remember where you put your ship before. 
</h2> 
<br>
<h1>Call your shot!</h1>
<br>
<h2>
<br> On your turn, pick a target coordinate on the map grid and call out its location by letter and number (coordinate)
<br> You can also easily fire by moving your cursor into the coordinate map and hover your cursor into one of the coordinate square
<br> when you call a shot, the map should tell you than whether you call a hit on the opponent ship or hit a miss

</h2>
<br><h1> It's a Hit!! </h1>
<h2>
<br> If you call a hit, than the picture of the grid square coordinate will change into a fire
<br> If you call a miss, than the picture of the grid square coordinate will change into a flag
<br> Which means that you have already call a shot at that exact place and it's a miss!
<br> Remember that you cannot call a shot twice in any grid square coordinate.
<br> Your task is to sink all the 5 ships by calling a shot and a hit at all ships that your opponent has!
</h2>
<br>
<h1> Winning the game </h1>
<h2>
<br> The first player who can sink all 5 ships of the opponent will win the game!!
